# Emergent Quantum-Like Behavior Without Physical Qubits

## Overview

This paper explores how quantum-like phenomena such as interference,
superposition, and delayed measurement can emerge from deterministic,
operator-based computation without physical qubits.

The focus is conceptual and explanatory.

---

## Purpose

- To clarify what “quantum-like” means in QFC
- To separate physical quantum mechanics from computational analogy
- To explain how interference arises from execution semantics
- To prevent category errors and overclaiming

---

## Key Ideas

- Superposition as deferred state resolution
- Interference as constrained state composition
- Measurement as projection and sealing
- Determinism underlying apparent indeterminacy

---

## What This Paper Does Not Claim

- No claim of quantum speedup
- No claim of physical quantum simulation
- No replacement for quantum hardware

---

## Position in the Stack

This document provides intuition for:

- QVM execution semantics
- interference-based optimization
- delayed commitment mechanisms

---

## Status

- Conceptual clarification
- Educational and explanatory
- Non-technical
